### Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

#### Who am I?

I am Artemii Kulikov, a 22-year-old currently living in Moscow.

#### What do I do?

I primarily focus on learning Golang (with a little bit of knowledge in C++) and enjoy developing simple Telegram apps, scripts, and games. I am available for open-source projects and am actively looking for internship opportunities to further develop my skills and gain experience.

I also have a great interest in bash scripting.

#### Hobbies:

- Coffee (especially V60)
- Jogging (although I've been lazy with this one lately)
- Indie-games (Factorio, Faster Than Light, Minecraft, etc.)
- Obscure horror films and videos on YouTube.
